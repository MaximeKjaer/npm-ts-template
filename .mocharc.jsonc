  // To run tests written in TS without having to compile them, we need
  // to run them in ts-node:
  "require": "ts-node/register",

  // Any *.test.ts file in ./test will be run as a test:
  "spec": "test/**/*.test.ts",

  // This will be available in the next version of Mocha (6.3.0?):
  "watch-files": ["test/**", "src/**"],

  // Until then, we need this:
  "watch-extensions": "ts"
